# Plot for Pokemon Olympia

### Chapter 0
Chapter 0 is solely for the introduction to character. Ask relevant details like name and gender like in typical pokemon games. 

TBA: Ask for rival's name. The rival is going to be another kid from a nearby village who arrives to help fight Team Krono in Chapter 2 of the game

### Chapter 1: New beginnings
The chapter begins with a short description of the village, and about the village festival that is going to start from tonight. The Professor, who's a family friend of the protagonist has sent a letter stating he would be arriving to enjoy the village festival.
The protagonist rushes to the marketplace to buy items for dinner. While running the errand, he also notices a few men dressed in black clothes with a Silver 'K' insignia but dismisses them as performers for the festival. He returns home to find Prof. Tumin already there. Surprised, he asks the professor why he's so early since he's supposed to be arriving in the evening. Prof just states he just happened to finish his work early.
Later Prof joins you on your farm where youre feeding Wooloos while simultaneously managing a very energetic Yamper. Impressed by your ability to manage and befriend pokemon so easily, he asks you to join him in the research.

Depending on whether you accept his offer or not, you will be able to choose between two different paths.

#### Path A: Accept the offer and become a researcher
You join Prof. Tumin's team as a Pkmn Researcher. He gives you a Pokedex which he upgrades to a Rotomdex. He shows you multiple features of the Rotomdex telling you how it's a special researcher edition, that also has a research log/journal built into it along with a Pokedex. As a researcher your job is to befriend and capture multiple pokemon so the professors can understand their behaviour and biology much better. Prof. Tumin then offers to give you a demo of how researchers do things. You decide to follow him into a grassy patch of land where you can encounter pokemon. The first pokemon you encounter happens to be a Pidgey who is a weak flying type. Prof. Tumin throws some bait at Pidgey and slowly approaches it, then throws a pokeball at it. The Pidgey is caught and the pokedex is automatically updated. Prof Tumin allows you to take a closer look at the pokeball he used.

It's a special prototype of pokeball, which instead of storing the pokemon inside itself like traditional pokeballs, transfers them to the Cerise Lab in Vermillion City. However, when the pokeball is released, the pokemon is transferred back. The technology used is similar to the one currently used to transfer pokeballs from professor to the trainer and back.

With this introduction, you both head back to the farm and see it's evening already. Time flew by so quickly!

#### Path B: Decline the offer and continue on your own
You refuse to join the research team. Prof. Tumin appears a little surprised and says he wasn't expecting a no but understands why you might have declined. He then decides to help you out with the farm work. He also asks if he could catalogue some of the pokemon to which you say yes. He scans a few wooloo with his rotomdex and then gets back to helping you carry the haystacks.


Notes: I want to make the story progress in such a way that even if the protag declines to be a research assistant he eventually ends up joining the prof on his journey.

### Chapter 2: The Village Festival
By the time you are done with everything, it's already evening. You can see the sun setting in the distance with the sky being tinged red. You and Prof. rush back to your house to tidy up so you won't be late for the festival. With excitment you rush to the town center. Prof. Tumin stops suddenly and buys some snack to which you agree is a good idea! Then you both run again. You arrive at the town center and the festival is about to begin. The crowd was truly lively and completely packed.
You find your mother in the crowd and sit and enjoy the fireworks while munching on the delicious snacks Tumin had bought for you.
